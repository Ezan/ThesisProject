Figure 1. LEEM micrographs (a, b, d) and LEED patterns (c, e) examining graphene domains on Cu(001). The red and blue dots in (b) and (d) are the locations where (c) and (e) were collected, respectively. The orange circles in (c) and (e) are centered on Cu diffraction spots, while the red and blue highlight diffraction from graphene. Many graphene islands growing on Cu(001) develop a distinct 4-lobed morphology, where the fast-growth direction of the lobes lies close to a Cu<100> in-plane direction, as is shown by the consistent island-to-island orientation in (a) (FOV = 46 µm). Also in (a) are graphene islands of other shapes, which typically form due to interactions with surface inhomogeneities and other graphene islands. The dark lower-left portion of (a) is a twinned region of the Cu(001) substrate. The lattice of the graphene domain in (b, c) is rotated 8º relative to the Cu surface (see spacer-arrows) in such a way as its fast-growth direction (red arrow in (b)) is closer to a C<11> direction. The graphene domain in (d, e) is rotated by 14º relative to the Cu (spacer-arrows), but has its fast-growth direction (blue arrow in (d)) close to a C<10> direction. Small and moderate lattice rotations, such as that in (b, c) are equally likely to be toward the C<10> and C<11> directions. Larger rotations, such as (d, e), almost always move the fast-growth direction towards a C<10> lattice direction. FOV in (b, d) is 7 µm.
