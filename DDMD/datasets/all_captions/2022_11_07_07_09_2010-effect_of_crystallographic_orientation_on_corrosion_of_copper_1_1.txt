Fig. 5. Specimens made from the wide ribbon and annealed at 1250~ appeared more and more shiny as oxidation proceeded. X-ray back-reflection measurements indi- cated the entire surface was oriented w i t h a (11-1) plane parallel to the surface. Microscopic examination revealed that the specimens were fairly large-grained of the order of millimeters in diameter. No striated grains were observed nor were any grains with the typical (.311) appearance (Fig. 5) observed. The surfaces were marked with die scratches from drawing and
