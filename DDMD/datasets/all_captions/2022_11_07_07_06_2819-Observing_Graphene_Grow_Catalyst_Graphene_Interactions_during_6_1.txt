Figure 5. Graphene growth on Cu with residual air in the CVD atmosphere. (a) Time-resolved C1s scan during C6H6 exposure. Time stamps refer to time elapsed after hydrocarbon introduction. The numbers in brackets indicate multipliers for intensities of separate scans. (b) O1s core level XP scans at 900 Â°C during (step 4) C6H6 exposure and after cooling in vacuum (step 6) where the circle and diamond represents the BEs of Cu2O and CuO, respectively.
