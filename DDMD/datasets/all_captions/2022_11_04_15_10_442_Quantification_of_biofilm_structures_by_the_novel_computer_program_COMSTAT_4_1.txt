Fig. 2. Spatial distribution of 7-d-old ﬂow-chamber-grown bioﬁlms of P. putida (a), P. aureofaciens (b), P. fluorescens (c) and P. aeruginosa (d) expressing GFP. The larger central plots are simulated ﬂuorescence projections, in which long shadows indicate large, high micro-colonies. Shown in the right and lower frames are vertical sections through the bioﬁlms collected at the positions indicated by the white triangles. The scale bars (representing 20 µm) shown in the central plots are also valid for the right and lower frames.
