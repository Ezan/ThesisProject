Figure 3. The biofilm wrinkling-to-delamination transition is controlled by adhesion energy. (A) Top (top) and side (bottom) views of biofilms on plates containing the designated concentrations of agar taken 10 hr after the onset of delamination. Scale bar: 5 mm (top) and 1 mm (bottom). (B) Surface topography of a biofilm grown on 0.5% agar at the onset of the wrinkling-to-delamination transition (36 hr). The arrow indicates a blister. Scale bar: 2 mm. (C) Cross-sectional views of rims of biofilms producing fluorescent mKate2, grown for 40 hr on plates containing 0.6% agar (left) and 1.0% agar (right). Scale bars: 0.5 mm. (D) Percentage () of blisters in all radially oriented features (wrinkles + blisters) versus agar substrate concentration for 2-day-old biofilms. The distinction between wrinkles and blisters is made on the basis of visual inspection. Insets: schematics showing how  depends on substrate stiffness. Red with black outline, biofilms; gray, agar substrate; blue, residual layer; cyan, liquid between the blisters and the agar. (E) Biofilm growth on a substrate with defined defects. Top: schematic. Yellow denotes the growing biofilm. Red crosses denote the eight defects that were generated by manually making holes in the agar. Bottom: bright-field images of typical experiments using the setup shown in the schematic (top), for biofilms grown on plates with the designated agar concentrations. Scale bars: 5 mm.
