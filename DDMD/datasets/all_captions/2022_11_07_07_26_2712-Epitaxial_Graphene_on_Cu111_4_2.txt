FIGURE 4. STM topography image and Raman spectroscopy of 0.8 monolayer of graphene on Cu(111). (a) STM topography image of 0.8 monolayer of graphene on Cu(111). The areas in blue are bare Cu(111) surface. Some domain boundaries of graphene are high- lighted with yellow lines. Scan size: 500 Ã— 500 nm2. (b) Raman spectroscopy of 0.8 monolayer of graphene on Cu(111).
