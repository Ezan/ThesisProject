FIGURE 2. STM topography images at the domain boundaries of graphene on Cu(111) and two most observed Moire´ patterns. (a) STM image at a domain boundary showing two different Moire´ patterns in the two domains. The periodicity of the Moire´ pattern for the upper left domain is ∼2.0 nm, and that for the lower right domain is around 5.8 nm. Scale bar: 10 nm. (b) Atomic resolution STM image at a domain boundary, showing the honeycomb structure of graphene. The Moire´ pattern in the upper left domain cannot be observed under this scanning condition. The periodicity of the Moire´ pattern in the lower right domain is ∼3.0 nm. Scale bar: 4 nm. Some adsorbates on the graphene surface are highlighted with blue circles in (a) and (b). (a) and (b) were recorded on different areas. (c) The most observed (∼30%) Moire´ pattern of graphene on Cu(111) with a periodicity of around 6.6 nm. The lattice orientation of graphene is strictly aligned with that of Cu(111). (d) Another typical Moire´ pattern of graphene on Cu(111) with a periodicity of ∼2.0 nm observed in our experiments. The misorientation angle is ∼7°.
