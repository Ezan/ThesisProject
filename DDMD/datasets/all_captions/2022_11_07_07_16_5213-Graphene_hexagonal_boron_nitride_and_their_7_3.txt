Fig. 13 Preparation methods of h-BN with the mechanical stripping method and the CVD method (The left group ﬁgures: (a) low magniﬁcation and large defocus of the h-BN TEM images. (b) The folding images for h-BN. The right group ﬁgures: (a) Photograph of a large h-BN ﬁlm on a silicon substrate. Scale bar is 1 cm. (b), SEM image shows a h-BN ﬁlm (scale bar 10 mm). (c and d) AFM image and line-scan proﬁle indicate that h-BN ﬁlm has uniform thickness of a 1 nm. Scale bar is 2 mm).38,133
