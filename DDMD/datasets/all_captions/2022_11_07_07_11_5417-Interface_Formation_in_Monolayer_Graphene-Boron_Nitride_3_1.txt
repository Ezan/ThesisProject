Figure 3. UHV STM of separate graphene, monolayer hexagonal boron nitride, and of graphene-boron nitride heterostructures on Ru(0001). (a) Ball and stick model showing the C and surface Ru layer (top) and STM image (bottom) of the monolayer graphene/Ru(0001) moiré structure. (b) Model (top) and STM image (bottom) of the h-BN/Ru(0001) moiré structure. For both graphene and h-BN, zigzag edges are aligned with the boundaries of the moiré unit cell. (c) Graphene-boron nitride heterostructure on Ru(0001). In addition to the pure (MLG; h-BN) phases, transition regions without the characteristic moiré structure exist near the interfaces. (d) High-magniﬁcation image of the graphene-boron nitride boundary.
