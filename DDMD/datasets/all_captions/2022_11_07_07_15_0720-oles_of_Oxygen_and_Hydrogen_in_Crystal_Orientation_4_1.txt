Figure 2.  Optical and electrical characterizations of graphene grown on singe-domain Cu(111) substrate. (a) Scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of a partial-coverage aligned graphene seeds on SiO2/Si, where the white dashed lines indicate the orientations of graphene and the arrows point out the coalescence of adjacent islands. Scale bar, 20 μm. (b) Optical image of continuous graphene. The inset shows a representative single-point Raman spectrum. The negligible D band indicates the growth of high-quality graphene film. Scale bar, 20 μm. (c) Schematic of two-point back-gated field-effect-transistor (FET) device. (d) Current −  voltage (ID −  VG) curve for the continuous graphene grown on Cu(111)-FET measured at room temperature. The right inset shows the SEM image of the device and the left inset shows a representative sheet resistance distribution of graphene film transferred onto SiO2/Si (1.5 mm in diameter).
