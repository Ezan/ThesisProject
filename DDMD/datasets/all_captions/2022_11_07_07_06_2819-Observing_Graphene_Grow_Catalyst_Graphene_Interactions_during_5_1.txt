Figure 4. Coupling and decoupling of graphene on Cu via oxygen intercalation as measured using in situ XPS for the (a) C1s and (b) O1s region (where the circle and diamond represents the BEs of Cu2O and CuO, respectively). (c) ESEM image sequence of ex situ grown, air transferred graphene nuclei on Cu during annealing in vacuum. Within the nuclei, regions of dark contrast are attributed to decoupled graphene and areas of light contrast to coupled graphene. Note that the green dashed line is a guide to the eye.
