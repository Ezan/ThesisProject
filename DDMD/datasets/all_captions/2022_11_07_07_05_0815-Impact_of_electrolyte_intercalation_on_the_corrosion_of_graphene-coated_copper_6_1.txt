Fig. 5(c). This is explained by the decomposition of the copper(II) car- bonate and copper(II) hydroxide into CuO [5]. The CuO/Cu2O compo- nent of O 1s1/2 (Fig. 5(d)) shows slight decrease in the intensity after annealing, while the other components disappeared completely. This should not be understood as a decrease in the relative volume of the oxides in the substrate. As was shown in the case of G/ Cu(1 1 1) the oxygen species from the contamination are seen before annealing, which are removed during the process. This contributes to the error in the estimation of the relative volumes of the oxides before annealing. As such we can use the Cu 2p3/2 and O 1s1/2 peaks after the annealing as the indicator and the gauge of the corrosion in the graphene-coated copper systems. In this case the atomic per- centages of copper and oxygen were equal to 99.5% and 0.5%, which suggest that the corrosion is much slower in the polycrystalline cop- per due to the graphene coating, but is not disabled completely.
