Figure 6. Temperature dependences of FOFC and FSCC (a) from 100 to 300 K and (b) from 5 to 100 K; FCu(standard) and FAg(standard) represent the reported value of Cu and Ag, respectively.19 The solid lines show the resistivities calculated for OFC and SCC from the Bloch-Gruâ‚¬neisen (BG) formula. The dotted lines represent the resistivities of copper samples with 4 N (FCu(4N)), 6 N (FCu(6N)), and 7 N (FCu(7N)) purity, as given in ref 23. (c) Resistivity reduction rates of OFC and SCC compared to FCu(standard).
