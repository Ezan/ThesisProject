Figure 5. (a, b) Schematic side view of perfect nucleation and growth of graphene on the Cu surface. (c, d) Optical and SEM image of graphene grains synthesized by increasing the growth temperature (1000 °C) for the growth. (e, f) Optical and SEM images of graphene grains synthesized by reducing the ﬂow rate of CH4 to 0.5 sccm for the growth. The annealing has been applied in the air for 20 min at 250 °C for all the observations.
