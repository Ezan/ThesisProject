Figure 5. Morphogenesis of a mutant biofilm possessing altered interfacial energies. (A) Bright-field (top) and cross-sectional (bottom) images of a V. cholerae Dbap1DrbmC mutant (abbreviated as DBC below) biofilm producing fluorescent mKate2, grown for 2 days on a 0.6% agar substrate. The red line in the top panel indicates the location of the cross-section used for the bottom panel. Scale bars: 2 mm (top) and 500 mm (bottom). (B) Close-up view of a star facet in a DBC biofilm grown on 0.6% agar for 36 hr. Scale bar: 1 mm. (C) Interfacial energies measured for the DBC biofilm. N.A. means too small to be measured. Data are represented as mean ± std with n = 3. (D) Schematic representations of DBC biofilm morphology development. Color code as in Figure 3D, except that yellow represents the DBC biofilm. (E) Transmission images of a section of a DBC biofilm growing on a 0.6% agar plate at the designated times. White arrowheads indicate emerging blisters. Four blisters (a–d) emerged during the time shown. Scale bar: 1 mm. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.43920.032 The following source data and figure supplements are available for figure 5:
