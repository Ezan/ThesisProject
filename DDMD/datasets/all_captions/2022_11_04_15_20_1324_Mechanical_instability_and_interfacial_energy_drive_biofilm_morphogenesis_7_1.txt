Figure 2. A trilayer mechanical model predicts the intrinsic wavelength of the biofilm pattern. (A) Number of wrinkles or blisters N versus the radial coordinate r during biofilm growth. The color scale indicates growth time t. Inset: closeup transmission image of a growing biofilm showing that wrinkles or blisters bifurcate to maintain a constant l. Agar concentration: 0.7%, scale bar: 2 mm. (B) The scaling relationship between l (normalized by the biofilm thickness h) and the shear modulus ratio Gf/Gs between the biofilm and the agar substrate. The black line indicates a slope of 1/3 on a log- log scale. (C) Characterization of the residual layer. Top: 3D topography of the residual layer after peeling a biofilm off of an agar substrate. Bottom: height profile extracted along the contour indicated by the dashed red line in the top panel. Both the raw (black) and smoothed (red) data, from which the residual layer thickness hr was calculated, are shown. Agar concentration: 0.5%. (D) Replot of the data in panel (B) taking into account the residual layer. The corrected biofilm thickness hf was obtained by subtracting the residual thickness hr from the total thickness h. The solid portion of the black line corresponds to the prediction from the bilayer model, which applies only to x coordinates greater than 4.75 (Wang and Zhao, 2015). The dashed portion of the black line is an extrapolation to zero from the bilayer prediction provided as a guide to the eye. The red line is the fitted data from the trilayer model in which the stiffness contrast between the residual and biofilm layers Gr/Gf is treated as a fitting parameter while holding hr/hf = 0.3. Inset: finite-element simulation of the trilayer model undergoing wrinkling instability. Red denotes the biofilm. Gray denotes the substrate. Blue denotes the residual layer. Simulation parameters were chosen to mimic the growth condition on 1.0% agar (black arrow). Data are represented as mean Â± std with n = 3.
