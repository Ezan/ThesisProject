FIG. 3. Northern blot analysis was used to conﬁrm differential reg- ulation of genes in response to excess copper identiﬁed by the microar- ray analysis. S. aureus SH1000 was grown in DM until an OD600 of 0.4 was reached. A total of 100 ␮M copper was then added, and following 30 min of incubation, total RNA was extracted. Ten micrograms of RNA was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridized with radiolabeled ahpF and sodM DNA probes (A) and radiolabeled oppA, agrC, and saeS DNA probes (B). Ethidium bromide-stained 23S and 16S rRNA provided loading controls.
