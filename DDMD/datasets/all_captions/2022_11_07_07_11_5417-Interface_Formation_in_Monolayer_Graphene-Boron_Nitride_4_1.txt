Figure 5. Controlled removal of C monomers from Ru(0001) near monolayer graphene domains. (a) LEEM image of a section of Ru(0001) surface adjacent to two monolayer graphene domains. (b) Simultaneous measurement of the LEEM I−V intensity at V = 2.2 eV on Ru(0001) (within the red circle in panel a) and of the area of one graphene domain (shaded blue in panel a). Lower intensity corresponds to higher C adatom concentration. Graphene growth (10−8 Torr C2H4; 740 °C) is followed by O2 exposure (2 × 10−9 Torr; 610 °C). A progressive increase in intensity accompanies the removal of C adatoms until saturation is reached at the level of clean Ru(0001). The area of the graphene domains remains nearly constant until the C adatoms are removed from the metal.
