FIGURE 1. STM topography and differential conductance dI/dV images of graphene islands on Cu(111). (a) STM topography image of 0.35 monolayer of graphene on Cu(111). Scale bar: 200 nm. (b) Differential conductance dI/dV image (U ) -200 mV) recorded simultaneously with the topography image (a). dI/dV signal can differentiate graphene from copper surface. Graphene shows dark contrast on this image. The areas highlighted with dotted lines are graphene domains showing Moire´ patterns. Scale bar: 200 nm. (c) A close-up dI/dV image of a graphene island (marked with “A” in (b)). Scale bar: 60 nm. (d) Atomic resolution STM topography image of graphene showing the Moire´ pattern and the honeycomb structure.
