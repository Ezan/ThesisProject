Figure 3. (a) SEM image of as-synthesized graphene grains without annealing. (b) Optical image of as-synthesized graphene grains transferred onto the SiO2/Si substrate. (c, d) Raman mapping of the 2D and D band intensity of graphene grains transferred onto the SiO2/ Si substrate. (e, f) Raman mapping of the 2D and D band intensity of an individual graphene grain transferred onto the SiO2/Si substrate. (g) Raman spectra of the diï¬€erent area as labeled A, B, and C in part e.
