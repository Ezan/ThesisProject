Fig. 1(b). It is signiﬁcantly different from that of Cu(1 1 1). Three sets of spots are visible, indicated by the red and blue hexagons. The inner, red hexagon corresponds to the surface of copper. The outer spots are connected by a ring, the presence of which indi- cates that there is a degree of disorder in the orientation of graph- ene domains in the coating [26,30]. Two of the orientations are favored because of the inﬂuence of the lattice of the substrate on the growth of the CVD graphene [31].
