Fig. 5 Reaction pathway and schematics of the entire oxidation processes. a Minimum energy pathway of the entire reaction of oxidation (energy barriers (Ea) in eV); started from the dissociation of water molecules at MVs and completed by the inversion of radical O atoms at GBs of graphene on Cu(111) substrate. The gray, white and red spheres indicate the C, H and O atoms, respectively. The diagrams represent the elementary steps of the Cu oxidation process including b the dissociative chemisorption of water vapors at point defects in Gr, c the migration of O adatoms on the Gr/Cu surface, d the accumulation of O atoms at the GBs of the Gr grains, and e the inversion of the O atoms at a SW defect with additional functional groups, followed by the selective oxidation of the Cu surface
