Figure 4.  DFT calculations of the effect of oxygen on the orientation transition from Cu(001) to Cu(111). The side (S) and top (T) views of the Cu surface without oxygen (a) and the favorable oxygen adsorption on Cu surface (c). Note that the oxygen atoms become far away from Cu(111), indicating the weakly bond to the Cu(111) surface. (b) The energy barrier between Cu(001) and Cu(111) without and with oxygen are 0.24 eV and 0.31 eV, respectively.
