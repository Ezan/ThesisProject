Figure 6. Delamination defines the overall biofilm contour. (A) Time evolution of acircularity index a (where a = P2/4pA, in which P is the perimeter of the biofilm and A is the area) of the biofilm contour. Two agar substrate concentrations are shown (0.4%, red; 1.0%, blue) for WT V. cholerae biofilms. The sharp upturn in a defines the critical time tc. Biofilms lacking matrix (DvpsL mutant; 0.4%, gray) or possessing an unstructured matrix (DrbmADbap1DrbmC mutant; 0.4%, black) remain circular. (B) Image of a WT V. cholerae biofilm grown on 0.7% agar 78 hr after inoculation, overlaid with the time evolution of the biofilm boundary. Colors correspond to the expanding boundary from 32 to 78 hr. Scale bar: 5 mm. Inset: schematic of local velocity Vf and the inverse of local curvature k√Ä1. (C) Transmitted light intensity profiles I (black), k (red), and Vf (blue) along the biofilm periphery from panel (B) at 60 hr. (D) Top: partial image of the biofilm shown in panel (B) at 75 hr. Red and blue dots denote two boundary points at the locations of a delaminated and a flat region, respectively. Arrows indicate boundary expansion. Middle and bottom: time evolution of Vf and k of the designated time points during biofilm development. Scale bar: 2 mm.
