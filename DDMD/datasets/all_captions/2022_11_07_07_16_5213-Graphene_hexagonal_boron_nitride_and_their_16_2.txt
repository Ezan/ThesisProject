Fig. 40 The ﬂow and test ﬁgure of an LED.((A) Schematic of the device architecture. (B) Magniﬁcation monochrome image of WSe2 LEQW device. The change of photon energy under diﬀerent temperature curve for WSe2 in (C) and MoSe2 in (D). (E) The image of quantum eﬃciency corresponding to temperature of three LED devices based WSe2. (F) Individual electroluminescence spectra plotted for four diﬀerent injection current densities for a sample device. (G) The external quantum eﬃciency plotted against bias voltage and injection current density at T ¼ 300 K for the same sample device in (F)).210
