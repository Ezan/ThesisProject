Figure 4. LEED patterns (a, c) and a LEEM micrograph (b) examining a graphene island on Cu(001). The blue and red dots in (b) are where (a) and (c) were collected, respectively. The orange circles in (a) and (c) are centered on Cu diffraction spots, while the red and blue highlight diffraction from graphene. Occasionally graphene islands have an atypical domain structure, where two neighboring island lobes are part of a single large domain (see approximate domain outline in (b)). In these circumstances, one lobe is C<10>, armchair-oriented (blue outlined section, blue arrow) while its neighbor is a C<11>, zigzag-tipped lobe (red outlined section, red arrow). The lattice rotation of the graphene domain is 4º, and the FOV in (b) is 7 µm.
