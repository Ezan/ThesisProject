Figure 2. Nano-Auger spectroscopy analysis of a monolayer graphene-boron nitride heterostructure grown by sequential CVD at high temperature (800 °C). (a) UHV SEM image of a MLG domain embedded in a continuous h-BN layer. Arrows designate the fast (step down) and slow (step up) growth directions of both MLG and h-BN. (b) Auger electron spectra at points near the center of the MLG domain and in the h-BN layer, marked in (a). (c) Nano-AES line scans for BKLL (171.6 eV), CKLL (260.6 eV), and NKLL (380.0 eV) Auger lines, along the line marked in (a). Points in the CKLL line scan, representing exponential decay ﬁts to the data, show the asymmetry in the near-interface composition proﬁles with half widths of 0.09 and 0.34 μm along the slow and fast h-BN growth directions, respectively.
