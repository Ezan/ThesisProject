Figure 1 shows low-energy electron microscopy (LEEM) images of sequential graphene and boron nitride growth on Ru. Monolayer graphene (MLG) domains with characteristic lens shape, determined by diﬀerences in the graphene growth rate in relation to the direction of surface steps on Ru(0001),12 are formed by exposing the substrate to ethylene. At partial graphene coverage, the ethylene supply is stopped, and the sample is subsequently exposed to borazine to initiate hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) growth.16 MLG and h-BN are easily distinguished by their diﬀerent LEEM image contrast. At low BN coverage (Figure 1a), all h-BN attaches to edges of existing MLG domains; no nucleation of h-BN on the Ru surface away from MLG is observed. Longer borazine exposure leads to progressively larger BN coverage (Figures 1b,c). The h- BN expands anisotropically, similar to the growth of MLG/ Ru(0001), with high rate along substrate terraces and downhill across steps and a lower rate in the uphill direction. Ultimately, the substrate is covered by a continuous layer comprising graphene domains embedded in boron nitride (Figure 1d). Our observations are consistent with large (several micrometers)
