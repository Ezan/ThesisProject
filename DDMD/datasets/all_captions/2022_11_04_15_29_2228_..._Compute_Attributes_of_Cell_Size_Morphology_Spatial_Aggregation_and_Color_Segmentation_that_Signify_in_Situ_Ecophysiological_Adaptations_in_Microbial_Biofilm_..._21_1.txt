Figure 6. In situ variation in intensity of cell communication between Pseudomonas putida reporter cells colonized on a wheat rhizoplane. (a) Red-fluorescent “signal source” cells communicating with green-fluorescent “signal sensor” cells via secreted N-acylhomoserine lactones; (b) Green color-segmented and (c) grayscale converted images of the communication response in Figure 6a; and (d) Frequency distribution of the mean luminosity of Gfp fluorescence per sensor cell indicating the in situ variation in cell communication intensity at single-cell resolution. Bar scale is 15 µm.
