Fig. 35 (a) Stacking of constant-energy maps of EDC curvature to show the conical dispersion at the two k points. d1–d5, dispersions along the cuts d1–d5 shown in a1. The white dashed lines are guides for the evolution of the SDCs dispersions. The black arrow indicates the dispersion from the original Dirac cone. (b) Schematic drawing of the band structure in the graphene/h-BN heterostructure, showing the gapped original Dirac point with gapped SDPs at three out of six corners of the SBZ (k points).198
