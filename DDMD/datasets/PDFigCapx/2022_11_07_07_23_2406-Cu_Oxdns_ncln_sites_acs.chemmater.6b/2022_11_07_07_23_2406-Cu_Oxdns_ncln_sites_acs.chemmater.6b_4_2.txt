Figure 4. (a) Magniﬁed SEM image of an individual graphene grain after thermal annealing in air. (b) AFM image of an individual graphene grain after transfer onto SiO2/Si substrate. (c) A magniﬁed AFM image of the nucleation site of the graphene grain transferred onto SiO2/Si substrate. (d) A schematic illustration showing the full process of nucleation, growth, and thermal annealing mechanisms.
