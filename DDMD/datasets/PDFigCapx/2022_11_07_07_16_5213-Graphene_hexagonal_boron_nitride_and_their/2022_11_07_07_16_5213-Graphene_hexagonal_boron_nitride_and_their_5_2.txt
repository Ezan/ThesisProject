Fig. 5 Several types of preparation methods of graphene (spectral analysis of graphene prepared by CVD method is shown from a to e in the left group ﬁgures. Sample image of graphene by epitaxial growth is shown from a to e in the middle of group ﬁgures. Epitaxial growth of graphene samples and their characteristics is shown from A to E in the right group ﬁgures).11,84,85
