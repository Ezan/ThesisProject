Fig. 32 The coupling mechanism of graphene plasmons and the h-BN optical phonons. (a) The schematic diagram of Graphene plasmon and h-BN o-TO phonon. (b) Plasmon frequencies as a function of wave vector for diﬀerent hybridized mode peaks. (c) Line proﬁle of s-SNOM optical signals at the excitation wavelength of 970 cmÀ1. (d) s-SNOM images from 2D scan of the tip position near the graphene edge with varied excitation wavelengths.192
