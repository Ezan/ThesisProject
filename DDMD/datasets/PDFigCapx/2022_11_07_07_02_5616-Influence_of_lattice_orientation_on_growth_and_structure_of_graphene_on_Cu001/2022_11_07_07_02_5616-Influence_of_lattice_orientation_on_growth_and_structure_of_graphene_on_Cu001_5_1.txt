Figure 2. Schematic diagram illustrating lattice directions and edges of the graphene lattice (the purple diamond is the graphene unit cell). Because the fast-growth direction remains near a Cu<100> direction, a rotation of the graphene lattice changes the lattice direction along which fast-growth occurs. When the lattice of a graphene domain approaches perfect alignment with the Cu(001) surface (i.e. C[10] â•‘ Cu[110] or Cu[1-10], see arrows on left of unit cell) the fast-growth direction is directly between a C<10> and a C<11> direction. Any rotation away from alignment moves the fast-growth direction towards either the C<10> or C<11> direction. A graphene edge which is perpendicular to a C<10> direction (blue) has the armchair structure, while an edge perpendicular to a C<11> direction (red) has the zigzag structure. The purple edge section is a mix of these two high-symmetry edge structures.
