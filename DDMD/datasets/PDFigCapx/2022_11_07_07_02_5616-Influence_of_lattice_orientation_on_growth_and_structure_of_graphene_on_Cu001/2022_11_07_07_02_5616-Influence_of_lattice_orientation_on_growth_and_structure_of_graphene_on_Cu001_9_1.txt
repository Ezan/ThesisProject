Figure 6. LEED from a graphene domain grown on Cu(001) (a) showing the diffraction spots of the ridged graphene-Cu(001) moiré (graphene lattice rotation is 6º). (b) A rendering from a simple geometric model of the graphene-Cu(001) surface, with the graphene lattice rotated by 6º (please see reference #[15] for model details). Brighter atoms are higher. The ridged moiré is clearly visible. (c) A plot summarizing how the graphene-Cu(001) moiré evolves as the graphene lattice rotates, and comparing its orientation and periodicity with those predicted by the model (open squares are from LEED, closed circles from the model). The model accurately recreates the orientation of the ridges, but consistently predicts a larger ridge spacing than is observed by LEED. This may be the result of a dilation in the LEED patterns, which would maintain angular fidelity but lead to consistent underestimation of the ridge spacing.
