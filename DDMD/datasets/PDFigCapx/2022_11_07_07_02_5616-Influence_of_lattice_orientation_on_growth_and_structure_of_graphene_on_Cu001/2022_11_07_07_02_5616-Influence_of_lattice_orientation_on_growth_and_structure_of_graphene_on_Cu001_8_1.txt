Figure 5. LEED patterns from graphene domains grown on Cu(001). Diffraction spots from the ridged graphene-Cu(001) moiré can be seen in (a) (yellow arrows, lattice rotation is 4º). Diffraction from domains rotated by more than ~9º, such as (b), does not show evidence of the ridged moiré (lattice rotation is 13º). The orientation and periodicity of the moiré ridges change with the graphene lattice orientation.
