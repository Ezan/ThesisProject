FIG. 2. Model of the S. aureus adaptive copper response. Excess copper induces the copper, protein misfolding, and oxidative stress regulons, represses virulence gene regulators Agr and Sae, and hence, represses bioÔ¨Ålm formation. Arrows indicate positive regulation, and dotted arrows indicate negative regulation.
