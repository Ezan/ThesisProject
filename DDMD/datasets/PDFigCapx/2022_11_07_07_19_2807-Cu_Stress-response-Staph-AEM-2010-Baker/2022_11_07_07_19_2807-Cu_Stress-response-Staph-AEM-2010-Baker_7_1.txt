FIG. 4. Effect of oxidative stress resistance gene mutations (A) and the addition of exogenous ROS quenchers (B) on growth in excess copper. The S. aureus SH1000 wild type and SH1000 ahpC, katA, ahpC katA, sodM, sodA, and sodM sodA mutant cultures were grown overnight in CRPMI, then diluted to an OD600 of 0.05 in fresh CRPMI with and without 50 or 100 ␮M copper, inoculated into quadruple wells of 96-well ﬂat-bottomed tissue culture plates, and incubated statically at 37°C for 24 h. After incubation, plates were read at 595 nm to monitor growth. Each point represents the mean result and standard deviation of at least 4 independent experiments. (B) A total of 500 U/ml of catalase or 10 U/ml of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes were added before incubation at 37°C, where indicated.
