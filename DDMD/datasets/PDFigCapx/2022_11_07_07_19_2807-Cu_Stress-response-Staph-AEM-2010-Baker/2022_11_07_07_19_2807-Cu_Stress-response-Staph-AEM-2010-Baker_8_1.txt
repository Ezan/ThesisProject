FIG. 5. Bioﬁlm (A and B) and Northern blot analysis (C) of S. aureus Newman grown for 24 h in CRPMI, showing the effect of copper and other metal ions on bioﬁlm formation and Eap expression. (B) Results represent the mean and standard deviation of at least four independent experiments. (C) A total of 10 ␮g of total RNA prepared from S. aureus Newman cells growing exponentially in CRPMI (lane 1), CRPMI with 50 ␮M Fe2 (SO4)3 (lane 2), or 10 ␮M copper chloride (lane 3) was resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis and hybridized with eap DNA probe. The blot was then stripped and rehybridized with the 16S rRNA control probe.
