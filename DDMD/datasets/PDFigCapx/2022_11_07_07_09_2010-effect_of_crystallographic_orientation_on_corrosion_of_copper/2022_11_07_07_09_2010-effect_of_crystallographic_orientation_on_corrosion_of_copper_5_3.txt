F i g u r e 11 w o u l d i n d i c a t e t h a t this is so. H e r e the oxidation occurred in water in equilibrium with an a t m o s p h e r e of 10% O~.. O n l y t h e r e s u l t s for the {111} and {100} planes are plotted since the {110} and {311} gave results similar to that for the {100}. For the 10% oxygen atmosphere the rate of Cu_.O f o r m - ation was greater than that for the stagnant 100% O._.case; t h i c k e r films of Cu.O w e r e f o r m e d , b u t less than in the 1% case. Moreover the behavior was logarithmic in nature rather than parabolic as was the case for a 1% oxygen atmosphere. The film thickness for this 10% case lay intermediate between the 100% ox~zgen and the 1% oxygen. The rate, how- ever, of cupric ion formation was also important. It was increased and hence the rate of Cu~O formation was still further inhibited. By allowing the crystal to stand in contact with the water and the 10% oxy- gen atmosphere for two days, CuO was observed to form in the same fashion as in the 100% oxygen case. After the thickness had leveled off to a constant value, the formation of CuO could be brought about immediately by replacing the 10% oxygen atmos- phere with pure oxygen.
