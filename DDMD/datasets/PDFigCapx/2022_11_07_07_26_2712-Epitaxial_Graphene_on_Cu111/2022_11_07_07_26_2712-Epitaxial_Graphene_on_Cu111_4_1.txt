FIGURE 3. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy of graphene on Cu(111). (a) STM topography image showing both graphene (marked with “G”) and Cu(111) (marked with “Cu”). Scale bar: 20 nm. (b) Differential conductance dI/dV image recorded simultaneously with the topog- raphy image (a). Graphene shows bright contrast. (c) dI/dV point spectra recorded on graphene and Cu(111). (d) dI/dV line map recorded at 100 points at equal distance along the dotted line in (b). The dI/dV spectra indicated by the arrows in (d) were recorded at the two boundaries between the graphene sheet and the Cu(111) substrate indicated by the arrows of the same colors in (b).
