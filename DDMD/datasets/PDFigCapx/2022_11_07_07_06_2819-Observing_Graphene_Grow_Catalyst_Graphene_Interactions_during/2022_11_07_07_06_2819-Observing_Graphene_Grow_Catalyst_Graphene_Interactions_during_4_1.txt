Figure 3. Surface chemistry of the Cu catalyst as loaded (before step 1), after H2 anneal (step 2), during hydrocarbon exposure (step 4), after cooling in vacuum (step 6), and after ambient air exposure (step 7) using (a) in situ XPS Cu LMM Auger, (b) Cu 2p3/2, and (c) O1s spectra [note that the as-loaded O1s scan was measured at a higher kinetic energy (450 eV) to penetrate the adventitious carbon from ambient air storage]. The numbers in brackets indicate multipliers for intensities of separate scans. Comparing a and b, we note that the Cu LMM Auger is more sensitive to changes in the oxidation state of Cu than the Cu 2p3/2 spectra.
