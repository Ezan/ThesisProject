Fig. 1 Selective 0D and 1D oxidation ﬁngerprints of fully-grown, air-annealed Gr/Cu samples at low temperatures. a OM images of the Gr/Cu sample after annealing at 200 °C for 30, 60, 90, or 120 min (from left to right) in air (scale bar=10 µm). b A representative SEM image of the Gr/Cu sample after annealing at ~200 °C for 120 min in air (scale bar=0.5 µm). c Depth-proﬁling HR-XPS O 1s line scans of the Gr/Cu sample after annealing at ~200 °C for 120 min in air, depending on the sputtering time. Curve ﬁttings of O 1-s spectra were performed using a Gaussian–Lorentzian peak shape after Shirley background correction. d Comparison between HR-XPS O 1-s peaks of the Gr/Cu samples annealed at ~200 °C for 60 and 120 min in air, depending on the sputtering times. Representative SEM and corresponding EBSD images of a continuous Gr ﬁlm grown on the grains of e Cu(001) and f Cu(111); the image was collected after an air oxidation process at ~200 °C for 60 min (scale bar=10 µm). The insets in e and f show the SEM images of partially grown Gr islands formed on grains of the Cu(001) and Cu(111), respectively (scale bar=2 μm). The bottom images in e and f show the EBSD images each taken from within one Cu crystal grain with resolution of ~0.1 μm2 per pixel (scale bar=3 μm), g A change in the long-axis lengths of the polygons formed on the annealed Gr/Cu samples measured by dark-ﬁeld TEM or SEM, depending on the methane ﬂow rate of 50 (upper) or 10 (bottom) sccm during CVD growth
