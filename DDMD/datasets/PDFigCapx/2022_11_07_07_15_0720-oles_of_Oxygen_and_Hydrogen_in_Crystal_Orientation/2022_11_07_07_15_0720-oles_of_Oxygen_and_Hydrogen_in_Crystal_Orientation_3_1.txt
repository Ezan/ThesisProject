Figure 1.  Surface morphology and structure characterizations of Cu foils annealed under 3 schemes. Scheme 1: heating and annealing under Ar flow. Scheme 2: heating and annealing under H2 and Ar flows, respectively. Scheme 3: heating and annealing under H2 flow. All the samples were heated up to 1040 °C under ambient pressure within 40 min, then annealed at 1040 °C for 30 min. (a–c) Optical images of Cu foils annealed under scheme 1–3. Scale bars, 50 μm. (d–f) EBSD orientation maps of Cu foils annealed under scheme 1–3. The left inset in (d–f) shows the corresponding inverse pole figure for each map displayed. Grains marked blue are oriented along plane Cu(111) while grains in red are along Cu(001). Scale bars, 200 μm (d,e); 500 μm (f). (g–i) XRD profiles of Cu foils annealed under scheme 1–3. The measurements of EBSD and XRD were made from the same area of Cu foils.
