Figure 3.  XPS analysis of the Cu foils annealed under 3 schemes. (a–c) Schematic structures for the XPS depth-profiling of three different thicknesses of copper oxides on corresponding substrate orientations. The orange layer refers to the copper oxides formed during annealing while the top red layer indicates the adsorption of oxygen from air. The thickness is not to scale. (d–f) Evolution of the O1s peaks as a function of sputter time. The Cu2O peak is at 530.05 eV while the peak of 532.80 eV is attributed to H2O41–43. (g–i) Relative atomic contents of O and Cu as a function of sputter time. Using SiO2 as a reference, the corresponding thicknesses of oxidation layers for scheme 1–3 are measured to be 60 nm, 3.6 nm and 3 nm, respectively.
