Fig. 1. Phylogenetic afﬁliation based on 16S rDNA sequences of the four Pseudomonas strains investigated (highlighted) among a number of bacteria belonging to the γ subclass of the Proteobacteria. The calculation of the phylogenetic tree was based on the neighbour-joining method. The tree was rooted with the sequence of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus as an outgroup. The scale bar corresponds to 0n01 substitutions per nucleotide position.
