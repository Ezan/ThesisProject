Fig S.1: RGB images of Neisseriaceae (top left), Capnocytophaga (top right), Actinomyces (middle left), Fusobacterium (middle right), Leptotrichia (bottom left) and Bacterium (bot- tom right) in the dental plaque bioﬁlm sample. Bacterium denotes a probe for all oral bacte- ria. It is used for methodologic purposes to evaluate the completeness of the set of speciﬁc probes. Hence, it is omitted from analysis of community spatial structure. The genera shown here were modeled as homogeneous Poisson process in the data analysis.
