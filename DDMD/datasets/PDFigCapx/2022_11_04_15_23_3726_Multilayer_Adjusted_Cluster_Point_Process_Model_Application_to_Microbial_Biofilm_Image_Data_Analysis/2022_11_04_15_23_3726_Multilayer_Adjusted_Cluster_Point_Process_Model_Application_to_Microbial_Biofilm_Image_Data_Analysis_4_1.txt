Fig 3: (a) The same image as in Figure 2, displaying channels corresponding to Corynebac- terium (Pink), Streptococcus (green) and Porphyromonas (Blue); and (b) cartoon depicting various corncob structures visible in the image. The corncob structures are present in areas of the image corresponding to the tip of the Corynebacterium. At the center of the dense clump of Corynebacterium in (a), no corncobs are observed. For other examples of bioÔ¨Ålm images with corncob structures in which both Streptococcus and Porphyromonas cells cluster around the same Corynebacterium cell, see Supplemental Figure S2, panel C, in Mark Welch et al. (2016).
