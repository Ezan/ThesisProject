FIG. 1. (Color online) EBSD images of (a) the unannealed Cu foil (1.4 mm Â 1.1 mm), (b) the Cu foil after anneal at 1035 C for 30 min in 40 mTorr H2 fol- lowed by 5 min in 145 mTorr CH4 (2.5 mm Â 1.9 mm), and (c) the EBSD legend. Corresponding inverse pole ﬁgures for (d) the unannealed Cu foil, (e) the Cu foil after graphene growth, and (f) the density map of the relative areas. Orientations are with respect to the surface normal, and the color map indicates the percent area that is covered by grains with that particular orientation.
