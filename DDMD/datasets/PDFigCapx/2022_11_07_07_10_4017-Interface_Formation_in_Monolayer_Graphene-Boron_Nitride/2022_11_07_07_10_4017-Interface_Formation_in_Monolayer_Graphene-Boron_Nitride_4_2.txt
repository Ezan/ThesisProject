Figure 6. Graphene-boron nitride heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces. (a) Overview STM image showing nanoscale graphene domains with attached h-BN. (b) High-resolution STM image of the interface between graphene (MLG) and boron nitride (h-BN) on Ru(0001). (c) Zoomed-in view of the interfacial boundary. (d) Schematic elevation map of MLG and h-BN moiresÃÅ (unit cells outlined) joined in an abrupt zigzag boundary (blue line).
