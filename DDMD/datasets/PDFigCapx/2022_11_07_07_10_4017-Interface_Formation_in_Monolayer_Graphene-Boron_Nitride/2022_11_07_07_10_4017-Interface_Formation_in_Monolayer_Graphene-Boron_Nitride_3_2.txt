Figure 4. High-resolution cryogenic STM near the graphene-boron nitride interface. (a) Overview image, showing h-BN and MLG areas, separated by a ﬂat interfacial zone with faint lines (L) and atomic-scale point-like protrusions (P). (b) Height proﬁle along the line segment shown in (a). (c) High-magniﬁcation image of the ﬂat near-interface zone, showing a honeycomb structure matching the h-BN atomic lattice and point-like protrusions. (Imaging parameters: VS = +2.0 V; I = 1.0 nA).
