Figure 1. Real-time microscopy of the synthesis of monolayer graphene-boron nitride heterostructures. Borazine CVD growth of boron nitride (h-BN) by attachment to monolayer graphene (MLG) domains, formed by exposure of the Ru substrate to ethylene (10−8 Torr; 800 °C). Elapsed time: (a) 250 s; (b) 400 s; (c) 550 s; (d) 670 s. Temperature: 780 °C. Borazine pressure: 2 × 10−8 Torr (a,b); 6 × 10−8 Torr (c,d). (e) Microdiﬀraction pattern of MLG (2 μm aperture, centered on black circle in panel d). (f) Microdiﬀraction pattern of h- BN (centered on white circle in panel d).
