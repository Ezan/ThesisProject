Figure 3. The thickness variations of bioﬁlm sections obtained from the endoscopic images for diﬀerent times after the biodegradation of BTX. (a) After 4 months, corresponding to Figure 2a; (b) after 5 months, corresponding to Figure 2b; (c) after 7 months, corresponding to Figure 2c. Linear sections were proﬁled across the center of bioﬁlm matrix as the dotted lines in Figure 2.
